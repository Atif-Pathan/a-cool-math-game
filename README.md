Not actually THE coolmathgames(https://www.coolmathgames.com/), its just a calculator. Which you can argue is a cool math game itself ;)

## Future Improvements:
- I would probably like to add keyboard functionality so you can use the keyboard to enter the numbers and operations
- I also want to add in some more complex operations, like exponents and brackets. Right now it will do the math 2 numbers at a time, mimicking a basic calculator. 


### This project was completed using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I learnt a lot about functions and different edge cases that exists with user input and actual calculator functionality.
